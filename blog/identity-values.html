          how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision

        I began my discovery of web development with a self-taught program called "theOdinProject", During this program there was a lot of temptation to use tools like ChatGPT to get code working, noone would mark me down or punish me for doing so, but I've found that the integrity to work through problems <em>the hard way</em> results in a lasting understanding. I am glad I worked the hard way and feel I have retained an amount of information that will set me up for success throughout DevAcademy.

        I think New Zealanders have a strong work ethic, which is evident in my parents who own a small business. They are dedicated to their work and have been resilient through adversity over the last 30+ years. They work long hours, often going above and beyond to ensure their business thrives. I think this perseverance and determination reflect that cultural value of hard work that I observe in many New Zealanders. Watching them has taught me the importance of persistence & resilience.

        I have a good grasp on when I'm not understanding something and am always willing to ask for help. I think this will help reduce the time I am stuck on small problems and help me focus on the overall learning objective.

        I try to always consider someone's perspective. I think this approach is particularly useful when working through group projects. For example, if I have finished my individual task and someone else is stuck on theirs, I believe there is great value in either explaining something I understand or collaborating to figure out a solution together.

        I think too much on open problems, doing things the right way versus getting them done. This can lead to spending far too much time on certain problems. I need to be cognisant of this fact and make sure I am planning obtainable goals in order to reign in my broad/unspecific ideas.

        I had a co-worker in the past who was a very poor planner, things would get done sporatically and because my work relied on theirs, I couldn't do tasks in the order I wanted and this left me frustrated. To solve this I communicated how I felt and explained that it would be a lot easier for me if they had a structure to the way they did things. They were very willing, and said they hadn't considered that their work was affecting me. This has taught me that communicating should more often than not, be the first strategy.
