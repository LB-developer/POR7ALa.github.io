          <em>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills learning?</em>
        </h2>
          <p class="sub-paragraph">
            <ol>
              <li>It's important to ask yourself questions to truly understand how you feel</li>
              <li>Understanding yourself emotionally will help you develop technically</li>
              <li>I prefer a goal orientated approach</li>
            </ol>

        <h2>
          <em>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</em>
        </h2>
          <p class="sub-paragraph">
            It is possible to get better at learning, but only when you are equipped with self-awareness. Identifying the things that you are experiencing is the first step in understanding how to change or work through your perspective to reach the best balance of productivity and mental drain. Similarly, it is possible to get better at working with others, understanding your own and others values while having empathy for others will allow you to reach mutually beneficial outcomes in personally preferable steps. 
          </p>
        <h2>
          <em>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</em>
        </h2>
        <p class="sub-paragraph">The importance of it's impact on technical skills.</p>
          
        <h2>
          <em>What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?</em>
        </h2>
        <p class="sub-paragraph">Putting them into action i.e. Trying to solidify what I think will be best for me at the bootcamp, before experiencing the bootcamp.</p>
          
        <h2>
          <em>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</em>
        </h2>
        <p class="sub-paragraph">Especially with the course being a bootcamp, understanding how to get the most out of a stressful time, human skills will help students maximise their learning and keep them from becoming overwhelmed.</p>
          
        <h2>
          <em>Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</em>
        </h2>
        <p class="sub-paragraph">It doesn't feel like a waste of time. We are going to be interacting with people, and ourselves, for the rest of our lives, to not be willing to think about how to improve the inevitable would be foolish.</p>
