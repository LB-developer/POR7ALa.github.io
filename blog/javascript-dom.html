          <h2><em>HTML & CSS + JavaScript</em></h2>

          <p>
            Combining only HTML & CSS creates a *static* web-page, there is a structure (HTML) and styling (CSS), but these two things alone are quite limited even though things can feel interactive i.e. A button changing colour on hover (:hover in CSS), but what if you wanted to change the buttons colour after every 3 clicks? With just HTML & CSS this is not possible, and thus an example of one of the many limiting factors that static web-pages possess, so how do we fix this limitation? We need what's called a <b>scripting language</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
            A scripting language is used to introduce interactive elements to static web-pages to make them dynamic. The most commonly used scripting language is JavaScript (JS). 
          <p>
            <p >To use an analogy, think of a regular old fence. The posts are the structure (HTML), the paint is the styling (CSS), and the motion sensors which open the gate when someone gets close to the fence is the dynamic interaction (JavaScript).</p>
          <h3 class="blog-sub-heading">What does that look like under the hood?</h3>
          
            Let's use the previous example of button hover and clicking three times in an example below
          
          <div class="codeExampleContainer">
            <p class="blog-sub-paragraph"><em>Try hovering the "CSS Only" button, and then clicking the "JS + CSS" three times</em></p>
            <div class="codeExampleHeader">
              <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">
                <button id="cssOnlyBtn" type="button">CSS Only</button>
                <button id="cssJavascriptBtn" type="button">CSS + JS</button>
              </p>
            <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">While CSS is a very powerful tool, it has it's limitations; if we were to attempt making the second button in CSS, we would find that CSS is unable to keep a count of how many times a button is pressed and thus the second button is not possible through CSS alone.
            <br>
            <br>
            Increased capacity, however, also comes with increased complexity. Below you will see the difference in code (<em>Though not the most optimal</em>) I've used to generate the styling of each button.</p>
            </div>
              
                <div class="codebox">
                  <div>
                    <pre><code class="language-css">
CSS:
/* when hovering 'CSS Only' button change its colour */
#cssOnlyBtn:hover { background-color: #6bb679; }
                    </code></pre>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    <pre>
                      <code class="language-javascript">
JavaScript:

// target the CSS + JS button

let javascriptButton = document.querySelector­('#cssJavascriptBtn')

// create a variable that stores how many times the button has been clicked

let btnClickCounter = 0

// when the button is clicked execute the curly brackets

javascriptButton.­addEventListener­('click', () => {

// add one to click counter

btnClickCounter++

// if the button has been clicked three times execute the following

if (btnClickCounter === 3) {

// reset click counter

btnClickCounter = 0

// generate and add random colour to javascriptButton

javascriptButton­.style. backgroundColor =

'#' + Math.floor(Math.random() * 16777215).toString(16)

}

})
                      </code>
                    </pre>
                    </p>
                  </div>
                </div>
              </div>
          
          <h2><em>The DOM</em></h2>
          <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">When applying JavaScript to a web-page we only manipulate the underlying HTML and CSS indirectly. Our web-browsers help us target the elements on a web-page by converting all of the elements to objects that can be manipulated by scripting languages, like JavaScript. Without the DOM we wouldn't be able to interact with, and, dynamically update the content and structure of the web page as easily or efficiently; the collective of all objects in a web-page is known as the Document Object Model or the DOM.

          
            <br>
            <br>
          You can see an example of using JavaScript to interact with the DOM by using a line from the code above:
          <br>
          <br>
          <em>"<b>document</b>.querySelector­('#cssJavascriptBtn')"</em>
          <br>
          <br>
          The line basically says find an element with the id(#) 'cssJavascriptBtn'
           

          </p>
          
          

          <h2><em>Control Flow & Loops</em></h2>
          
          <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">
          Control flow just means the order in which things are executed; putting your socks on before your shoes, is an example of a control flow.<br>
          <br>
            The two most important control flows are conditional statements, and, loops.
          <br>
          <br>
            A <b>conditional statement</b> asks if a condition is true and <em>then</em> executes a block of code.
          <br>
          A <b>loop</b> executes a block of code <em>until</em> a condition is true.<br>
          <br>
          Two of the easiest control flows to follow when unfamiliar with programming are an <em><b>if</b></em> statement and a <em><b>while</b> loop</em>.
          <br>
          An if statement just asks if something inside the parenthesis <span class="codeBracketOne">( )</span> is true, then execute what is in the curly braces <span class="codeBracketOne">{ }</span>, if the statement is not true it moves on without executing anything unless specified to do so with an else or else if statment.
        </p>
          <br>
          <em>Let's use our shoes and socks example to show these control flow can be executed in JavaScript.</em>
          <br>
          
          </p>
          
            <div>
                <pre><code class="language-javascript">if (socks are on) {
put shoes on
}
</code></pre>
            </div>
            <div>
              <pre><code class="language-javascript">while (socks aren't on) {
don't put shoes on
} else { put shoes on }
</code></pre>
          </div>
          
          <p>
            As you can see, we can use these different types of control flows to check whether our task is complete, as to which use is 'correct' depends on the question and implementation.
          </p>
          
          <h2><em>Arrays & Objects</em></h2>
          <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">Arrays and objects are similar in the fact that they are both containers of data that are iterable & changeable, let's look at an example to understand how they differ.
          </p> 
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">
let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

let car = {
  year: '2006',
  colour: 'blue',
  wheels: 4
}
          </code></pre>
          <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">
          Notice that how they differ is how they hold their data. The array offers a simple list of values, while an object offers a named set of key value pairs.  
          <br>
          <br>
          Their uses also differ greatly as you can imagine, if I wanted to hold the numbers 1 - 5, I could create 5 objects with a key:value pairs, or more efficiently create an array as I have done above.

          Similarly, if I wanted to store information about my car, it wouldn't be practical to make 5 separate arrays for each piece of information. Instead, I would use an object to store the related data in key:value pairs, where each key represents a different attribute of the car.
          </p>
          <h2><em>Functions</em></h2>

          <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">A function is a pre-defined block of code that can be called on with its given name.
            <br>
            <br>
          To understand why this is useful, look back at the JavaScript code for the button above. Imagine we want to add that three click functionality to another button; should we copy and paste all those lines of code and change our variables to target our new button, or, should we wrap our original code in a function that automatically applies the functionality to whatever button name you pass through? This is the power of functions, the necessity for repetition in programming calls for simplification, which functions provide.
          </p>
          
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">   
  // making the function
  function helloWorld() {
  console.log('Hello World!')
  }

  // asking the function to run
  helloWorld()
            </code></pre>
          
          
      </div>
