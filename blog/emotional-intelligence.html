          <h2><em>What is Emotional Intelligence (EQ)?</em></h2>

          <p>
            Emotional quotient (EQ) is the awareness and understanding of emotions. To be able to acknowledge what you or others are feeling, having the power to separate and define what seems like one ball of emotion, to then be something to be guided, would be a characteristic of someone who is emotionally intelligent. 
            <p>

          <h3 class="blog-sub-heading">How does it differ from Cognitive Intelligence (IQ)</h3>
          <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">
          IQ means to express someones cognitive ability through their abilities of reasoning and processing. It is how someone uses logic to solve problems, how they plan to complete goals, it is how they learn.
          <br>
          <br>
          IQ is only focused on the task-solving engines in the brain whereas EQ focuses on recognizing and managing emotions.

          <h2><em>Why is EQ important</em></h2>

          <p>Being emotionally intelligent will allow you to sense and understand yours, and, others emotions.
