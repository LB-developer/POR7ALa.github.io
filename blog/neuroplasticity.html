          <h2><em>The Brain Is A Muscle.</em></h2>

          <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">
            The brain is a muscle like any other, if you neglect it, it will never change. When we practice something, we not only strengthen our understanding of that thing we practice, but also, the brains ability to practice, just like how if you start working out at the gym, you might not even be able to get through a full workout. This is just the same as if you start truly practicing/learning something for the first time. You struggle to keep up with new information? Well, you've never worked your brain out, of course it can't keep up with the workout you planned for it. 
          <p>


          <h2><em>Practice, Practice, Practice</em></h2>
          <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">
          Muscle growth is all about repetition, and the brain in this case is no different from a muscle. When you practice something over and over again, you get better at it. Neuroplasticity understands continual practice as building and strengthening neural pathways e.g. Imagine you have to walk through the bush every day to get to work. The first time you go, the ground is uneven, dangerous, unpredictable, but, if you walk the same way every day, if you step in the same spots, that ground begins to flatten and you create a path that makes that walk easy. Practicing works the exact same way, the beginning is rough, but over time we carve a pathway in our brain that makes practicing and learning, easier and easier.

          <h2><em>The Growth Mindset</em></h2>
            <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">
            Talent is a very common word used to describe someones ability, when you think "talented", you probably think of "the best of the best", the people who have proven that they are better than others at something. But talent is usually given as an answer as to how they got there. What we actually find, when looking at those best of the best, is so consistently how much work they put in. Whatever the discipline, whatever the reason, becoming the best is not simply a gift, it is something that is earned from the challenging of oneself, the drive to improve, the will to grow.

            <br>
            The growth mindset is as simple as believing that you can improve over time. It is the ability to deny the comfort of talent, and instead face the reality that only hard work will take you from where you are, to where you want to be.
