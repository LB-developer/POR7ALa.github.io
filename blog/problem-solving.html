          <h2>Talk about a time you were blocked on a simple problem.</h2>

          <p>
            <h3><em>What was the problem?</em></h3>
              <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">I was working through an exercise that should have been producing the correct answer, I constructed a simple for loop that on each iteration added or removed an item from an array depending on a condition. 
            </p>
            <h3><em>What problem solving techniques did you use?</em></h3>
              <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">Checking the relevant documentation (.push() in this case), using pseudocode to make sure I understood the logic, creating a checklist of what should be happening and checking the relevant code.</p>
            <h3><em>How did you feel throughout the process?</em></h3>
              <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">Like an idiot; It's like I thought I had followed a recipe perfectly, but how was something going wrong if I could go over the checklist again and again, and find nothing.</p>
            <h3><em>What did you learn?</em></h3>
              <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">Look for typos</p>
          </p>
<br>

          <h2><em>Talk about a time you elegantly solved a problem</em></h2>
          <p>
            <h3><em>What was the problem?</em></h3>
              <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">I was trying to construct a code box for showing coding examples in my blog.
            </p>
            <h3><em>What problem solving techniques did you use?</em></h3>
              <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">Googling! There were many different answers, mostly on StackOverflow (a popular developer forum).</p>
            <h3><em>How did you feel throughout the process?</em></h3>
              <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">Frustrated. The current implentation I had was extremely manual, (highlighting each word by a given colour to represent code highlighting) and was taking far too much time to achieve for such a small thing.</p>
            <h3><em>What did you learn?</em></h3>
              <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">Borrow from others. I ended up deleting all of my codebox styling and instead imported a popular codebox tool called prism.js that automatically styles your code for you. Although it does add dependency issues in the long run, it let's me focus on the content of the blogs themselves rather than the labourious styling I was implementing.</p>
          </p>
          
          <br>

          <h2><em>Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-soliving techniques/processes</em></h2>
          <p>
            <h3><em>Psuedocode</em></h3>
              <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">
                I am confident using pseudocode either as a beginning i.e. "What do I want this section to do, overall" or/aswell as working alongside the code generation process.
              </p>
            <h3><em>Trying something</em></h3>
              <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">
                I prefer "trying something" for smaller tasks, it's quite easy to keep track of what I need something to do when the task is small, especially when the solution is the answer to a question, additionally, it feels like reinforced learning to watch, and be able to debug why something is going wrong in real-time, though I think this will become a less preferable method as I become more familiar/comfortable with coding in general.
              </p>
            <h3><em>Rubber ducky method</em></h3>
              <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">Rubber ducky is still something I'm practicing, it's so easy to fall back into my own head. I usually pair any rubber ducky method with some type of checklist/journaling of the problem and use the writing as checkpoints for explaining</p>
            <h3><em>Reading error messages</em></h3>
              <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">Reading error messages alone depends on the error itself, some seem very complicated and I need to google the error code to even understand what it's saying, however, something that I am confident with is using the ability to see where the error is; It contextualizes the errors in a way that just seeing the code itself would not provide.</p>
            <h3><em>Console.logging</em></h3>
              <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">I use console.log() extensively, getting feedback from the code itself, where we are, what is happening, or rather, what we want to be happening; It is one of the first things I do when implenting a new piece of code</p>
            <h3><em>Googling</em></h3>
              <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">
                I think in general I'm quite confident in being able to condense my problems into their root issues (the foundational reason something is not working), though I think I need to learn more about using specific search parameters like "site:" and using quotes. I believe those kinds of things will allow me to find relevant answers faster.
              </p>
            <h3><em>Asking your peers for help</em></h3>
              <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">A popular 'mantra' I have heard is that "if you are struggling with something, someone else has too", Asking peers for help is the easiest way to take advantage of this mantra and I'm very confident about leveraging the knowledge of others.</p>
            <h3><em>Asking coaches for help</em></h3>
              <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">I do struggle with this in a way. I have no problem reaching out and asking for help, but I am always looking to work through a problem to learn as much as possible, rather than get the answer correct and have "completed" the problem. I feel like, if I overcome my lack of understanding then I will learn more, but it is a fine line between pushing through and wasting time.</p>
            <h3><em>Improving your process with reflection</em></h3>
              <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">I am now starting to try and understand my interpretation of problems at the beginning, which I can refer to at the end and compare, if something wasn't what I expected, why? I find it a lot easier said that done though, especially with long/detailed projects, understanding your understanding of something is almost another task in itself, which, when frustrated with working through problems, is easy to cast aside.</p>
          </p>

          <br>

          <h2><em>Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?</em></h2>
          <p>
              <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">I remember a particular time using the ".forEach()" method when trying to change the originally input array, but I couldnt figure out the specific syntax I needed to use. What made me reluctant to reach out for help was that I felt, "if I'm trying to learn as much as possible" then working through and solving the problem on my own would solidify the information in my mind, rather than having someone point me in the right direction or even give the answer to me, which could lead to a sort-of understanding.
