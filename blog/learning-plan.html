        <h1>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h1>
        <h2><em>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</em></h2>

        <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">I don't have a particular destination in mind, but I know I want to leave the bootcamp confident in my programming abilities, with the skills to pick up other programming languages on my own, and be more comfortable reading others codebases.</p>


        <h2><em>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp</em></h2>
        <h3 class="blog-sub-heading">Strengths:</h3>
        <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">
        Willingness to learn. I have had the bootcamp as a focus throughout foundations and am excited to get started.
        </p>
        <h3 class="blog-sub-heading">Limitations:</h3>

        <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">Working with new people. I imagine it is going to take some time to adapt to one another especially with pair programming. Thinking about it now, I have been implementing all of my code on my own, and I wonder how well I'm going to adapt to that kind of collaboration no matter how willing I am.</p>

        <h2><em>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</em></h2>

        <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">Time-management, but I think this will become easier as I become more familiar with the structure of the bootcamp.</p>

        <h2><em>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</em></h2>

        <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">Just talking in general, being able to put my thoughts into words, and even more so being able to put code into words.</p>

        <h2><em>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</em></h2>

        <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">I expect the Bootcamp team, just like the Foundations team, to be willing to answer questions, to be honest with their criticism, and remain approachable.</p>
        
        <h2><em>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</em></h2>

        <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">I expect myself to work hard, to learn as much as possible, and, to better understand the best methods for me to learn at, and, beyond the course.</p>
        





        <h1>Foundations Learning Plan</h1>
        <h2><em>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</em></h2>

          <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">I most importantly want to <em>learn how to learn</em> programming. I hear so much of how quickly this industry evolves and want to be able to not only "catch up" but also understand the steps it takes to move with that constant change. </p>


          <h2><em>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.</em></h2>
          <h3 class="blog-sub-heading">Strengths:</h3>
          <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">
          I am quick to understand the basics of new things and know when I don't know things. Furthermore, I am also willing to seek help for the things I am struggling with.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">
          I communicate well with others and actively try to consider how my communication will be received from their perspective.
          </p>
          <h3 class="blog-sub-heading">Limitations:</h3>

          <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">I try to implement the best way of doing something first and am now starting to appreciate the ability to first, get something working, and then polishing it later.  </p>

          <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">I tend to overthink situations, leaving seemingly simple tasks to be overworked by trying to find "perfect" solutions which are nearly never required. </p>


          <h2><em>What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</em></h2>

          <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">Less apprehension toward sharing work, allowing things to not be perfect.</p>

          <h2><em>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</em></h2>

          <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">I will be goal-oriented throughout the course. Understanding what the courses and my own personal end goal is (per assignment/week) and breaking it down into sub-goals which become the objective for productivity. I will work with and seek the advice of facilitators, and, compare my goals to those in my cohort to better understand whether my goals are reasonable or not.</p>

          <h2><em>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</em></h2>

          <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">I expect the facilitation team to be willing to answer questions, to be honest with their criticism, and remain approachable.</p>
