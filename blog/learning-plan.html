          <h2><em>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</em></h2>

          <p>I most importantly want to <em>learn how to learn</em> programming. I hear so much of how quickly this industry evolves and want to be able to not only "catch up" but also understand the steps it takes to move with that constant change. </p>


          <h2><em>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.</em></h2>
          <h3 class="blog-sub-heading">Strengths:</h3>
          <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">
          I am quick to understand the basics of new things and know when I don't know things. Furthermore, I am also willing to seek help for the things I am struggling with.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">
          I communicate well with others and actively try to consider how my communication will be received from their perspective.
          </p>
          <h3 class="blog-sub-heading">Limitations:</h3>

          <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">I try to implement the best way of doing something first and am now starting to appreciate the ability to first, get something working, and then polishing it later.  </p>

          <p class="blog-sub-paragraph">I tend to overthink situations, leaving seemingly simple tasks to be overworked by trying to find "perfect" solutions which are nearly never required. </p>


          <h2><em>What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</em></h2>

          <p>Less apprehension toward sharing work, allowing things to not be perfect.</p>

          <h2><em>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</em></h2>

          <p>I will be goal-oriented throughout the course. Understanding what the courses and my own personal end goal is (per assignment/week) and breaking it down into sub-goals which become the objective for productivity. I will work with and seek the advice of facilitators, and, compare my goals to those in my cohort to better understand whether my goals are reasonable or not.</p>

          <h2><em>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</em></h2>

          <p>I expect the facilitation team to be willing to answer questions, to be honest with their criticism, and remain approachable.</p>
